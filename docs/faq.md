# FAQ - Threat Intelligence

## General Questions

### What is the Threat Intelligence module?

The Threat Intelligence module is a comprehensive framework for aggregating, processing, and querying threat intelligence data from multiple sources. It provides real-time threat assessment, risk scoring, and capability-based querying for security operations.

### What makes this different from other threat intelligence solutions?

This module is designed specifically for Rust applications with:
- **Multi-source aggregation**: MITRE ATT&CK, CVE databases, OSINT feeds
- **Real-time processing**: HTTP-based fetching with configurable update intervals
- **Capability-based querying**: Find threats by specific capabilities rather than just keywords
- **Risk assessment**: Automated risk scoring and priority management
- **Type-safe API**: Built with Rust's type system for compile-time safety

### What threat intelligence sources are supported?

Currently supported sources include:
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: Tactics, techniques, and procedures
- **CVE Database**: Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
- **OSINT Feeds**: Open source intelligence from various providers
- **Custom Sources**: Extensible framework for adding new data sources

## Technical Questions

### How do I add a new threat intelligence source?

You can add new sources by implementing the `ThreatSource` trait:

```rust
use threat_intel::{ThreatSource, ThreatData, SourceConfig};

struct MyCustomSource {
    config: SourceConfig,
}

#[async_trait]
impl ThreatSource for MyCustomSource {
    async fn fetch_threats(&self) -> Result<Vec<ThreatData>, Error> {
        // Implement your custom fetching logic
        Ok(vec![])
    }
    
    fn get_source_info(&self) -> &SourceConfig {
        &self.config
    }
}
```

### How often is threat data updated?

Update frequency is configurable per source:
- **Real-time**: Updates every few minutes for critical sources
- **Daily**: Standard daily updates for most sources
- **Weekly**: Less critical or slow-changing sources
- **Manual**: On-demand updates when needed

### What is capability-based querying?

Instead of searching by keywords, you can query threats by specific capabilities:

```rust
// Find threats that can perform privilege escalation
let threats = registry.query_by_capability("privilege_escalation").await?;

// Find threats targeting specific technologies
let threats = registry.query_by_capability("targets_kubernetes").await?;
```

### How is risk scoring calculated?

Risk scores are calculated based on multiple factors:
- **CVSS Score**: For vulnerability-based threats
- **MITRE Impact**: Tactical impact assessment
- **Recency**: How recent the threat was observed
- **Source Reliability**: Trust level of the intelligence source
- **Capability Match**: How well the threat matches your environment

## Integration Questions

### How do I integrate this with my existing security tools?

The module provides several integration points:
- **REST API**: HTTP endpoints for external tool integration
- **Webhook Support**: Real-time notifications to external systems
- **Database Export**: Export threat data to external databases
- **SIEM Integration**: Compatible with major SIEM platforms

### Can I use this with SIEM platforms?

Yes, the module supports integration with major SIEM platforms:
- **Splunk**: Custom app for Splunk integration
- **Elastic SIEM**: Elasticsearch integration
- **IBM QRadar**: Custom connector available
- **Microsoft Sentinel**: Azure integration support

### How do I configure authentication for threat sources?

Authentication is configured per source:

```rust
let config = SourceConfig {
    url: "https://api.threat-source.com".to_string(),
    auth: AuthConfig::BearerToken {
        token: "your-api-token".to_string(),
    },
    update_interval: Duration::from_secs(3600),
    priority: Priority::High,
};
```

## Performance Questions

### How does the module handle large volumes of threat data?

The module is optimized for high-volume processing:
- **Streaming Processing**: Processes threats as they arrive
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage with streaming
- **Caching**: Intelligent caching of frequently accessed data
- **Batch Operations**: Batch processing for bulk operations

### What are the memory requirements?

Memory usage depends on your configuration:
- **Minimal**: ~50MB for basic setup
- **Standard**: ~200MB for typical enterprise use
- **High-volume**: ~500MB+ for large-scale deployments

### How does it handle network failures?

The module includes robust error handling:
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Fallback Sources**: Multiple sources for redundancy
- **Offline Mode**: Continue operation with cached data
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and monitoring

## Security Questions

### How is sensitive threat data protected?

Security features include:
- **Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails
- **Data Retention**: Configurable data retention policies

### Can I use this in air-gapped environments?

Yes, the module supports air-gapped deployments:
- **Offline Sources**: Local file-based threat sources
- **Export/Import**: Data export for offline analysis
- **Local Processing**: All processing happens locally
- **No External Dependencies**: Optional external connectivity

## Troubleshooting

### Why am I not receiving threat updates?

Common causes:
1. **Network Issues**: Check connectivity to threat sources
2. **Authentication**: Verify API credentials
3. **Rate Limiting**: Check if you're hitting rate limits
4. **Configuration**: Verify source configuration

### How do I debug threat data processing?

Enable debug logging:

```rust
use log::LevelFilter;

// Enable debug logging
env_logger::Builder::from_default_env()
    .filter_level(LevelFilter::Debug)
    .init();
```

### What if a threat source is down?

The module handles source failures gracefully:
- **Automatic Retry**: Retries failed sources automatically
- **Fallback Data**: Uses cached data when sources are unavailable
- **Health Monitoring**: Alerts when sources are consistently down
- **Manual Override**: Force updates when needed

## Best Practices

### How should I structure my threat intelligence queries?

Best practices for querying:
1. **Use Capabilities**: Query by capabilities rather than keywords
2. **Filter by Priority**: Focus on high-priority threats first
3. **Time-based Filtering**: Use recent threats for current analysis
4. **Combine Sources**: Cross-reference multiple sources

### How do I optimize performance?

Performance optimization tips:
1. **Configure Update Intervals**: Balance freshness vs. performance
2. **Use Caching**: Enable caching for frequently accessed data
3. **Filter Early**: Apply filters as early as possible
4. **Monitor Resources**: Use built-in monitoring tools

### What's the recommended deployment architecture?

Recommended architecture:
- **Centralized**: Single instance for small to medium deployments
- **Distributed**: Multiple instances for large-scale deployments
- **Hybrid**: Centralized processing with distributed collection
- **Cloud**: Cloud-native deployment for scalability
