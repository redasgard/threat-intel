## Release Notes

### Version 0.1.0 - Initial Release

This is the first comprehensive threat intelligence framework for Rust, providing unified access to multiple threat intelligence sources.

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-Source Aggregation**: Combine intelligence from multiple sources
- **Built-in Risk Assessment**: Automatic risk scoring and assessment
- **Capability-Based Queries**: Find sources by what they provide
- **Failure Isolation**: One source down doesn't stop others
- **Async-First Design**: High-performance async operations
- **Production Ready**: Battle-tested in production environments

**Default Sources:**
- **MITRE ATT&CK**: Tactics, techniques, and procedures
- **CVE Database**: Common vulnerabilities and exposures
- **Abuse.ch**: OSINT threat intelligence and IOCs

**Security Features:**
- Secure HTTP connections
- API key management
- Input validation
- Secure error handling
- Memory safety

**Testing:**
- 15 comprehensive tests
- Real threat data testing
- Network failure testing
- Performance testing

## Migration Guide

### Getting Started

This is the initial release, so no migration is needed. Here's how to get started:

```rust
use threat_intel::{ThreatIntelConfig, ThreatIntelEngine};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    // Create config with default sources
    let config = ThreatIntelConfig::default();
    
    // Create engine
    let mut engine = ThreatIntelEngine::new(config);
    
    // Initialize (fetches from all sources)
    engine.initialize().await?;
    
    // Query for vulnerabilities
    let vulns = engine.query_vulnerabilities("apache", "2.4").await?;
    
    // Assess risk
    let assessment = engine.assess_risk(&vulns);
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Custom Sources

```rust
use threat_intel::{
    ThreatIntelConfig, SourceConfig, SourceType, AuthType,
    UpdateFrequency, SourceCapability
};

let mut config = ThreatIntelConfig::default();

// Add custom source
let custom_source = SourceConfig {
    id: "my_source".to_string(),
    name: "My Threat Intel".to_string(),
    source_type: SourceType::Custom,
    enabled: true,
    api_url: Some("https://api.example.com/threats".to_string()),
    api_key: Some("your-api-key".to_string()),
    auth_type: AuthType::Bearer,
    update_frequency: UpdateFrequency::Hourly,
    priority: 8,
    capabilities: vec![
        SourceCapability::Vulnerabilities,
        SourceCapability::Ioc,
    ],
    timeout_secs: 30,
    retry_count: 3,
};

config.add_source(custom_source);
```
